University project about MSP430 microcontroller. Project's aim is to design and create system wich will generate some signals, 
apply noises and later view the resulting shape on oscilloscope. Some of the technologies we had to use are:
DMA transfer, ADC and DAC conversion, UART transmission, Watchdog timer and Non Volatile Memory.
